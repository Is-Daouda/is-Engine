# This script provides the SFML libraries as imported targets
# ------------------------------------
#
# Usage
# -----
#
# When you try to locate the SFML libraries, you must specify which modules you want to use (system, window, graphics, network, audio, main).
# If none is given, no imported target will be created and you won't be able to link to SFML libraries.
# example:
#   find_package(SFML COMPONENTS graphics window system) # find the graphics, window and system modules
#
# You can enforce a specific version, either MAJOR.MINOR or only MAJOR.
# If nothing is specified, the version won't be checked (i.e. any version will be accepted).
# example:
#   find_package(SFML COMPONENTS ...)     # no specific version required
#   find_package(SFML 2 COMPONENTS ...)   # any 2.x version
#   find_package(SFML 2.6 COMPONENTS ...) # version 2.6 or greater
#
# By default, the dynamic libraries of SFML will be found. To find the static ones instead,
# you must set the SFML_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable to TRUE before calling find_package(SFML ...).
# You don't need to deal with SFML's dependencies when linking your targets against SFML libraries,
# they will all be configured automatically, even if you use SFML static libraries.
# example:
#   set(SFML_STATIC_LIBRARIES TRUE)
#   find_package(SFML 2 COMPONENTS network system)
#
# On macOS by default CMake will search for frameworks. If you want to use static libraries and have installed
# both SFML frameworks and SFML static libraries, your must set CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK to "NEVER" or "LAST"
# in addition to setting SFML_STATIC_LIBRARIES to TRUE. Otherwise CMake will check the frameworks bundle config and
# fail after finding out that it does not provide static libraries. Please refer to CMake documentation for more details.
#
# Additionally, keep in mind that SFML frameworks are only available as release libraries unlike dylibs which
# are available for both release and debug modes.
#
# If SFML is not installed in a standard path, you can use the SFML_DIR CMake variable
# to tell CMake where SFML's config file is located (PREFIX/lib/cmake/SFML for a library-based installation,
# and PREFIX/SFML.framework/Resources/CMake on macOS for a framework-based installation).
#
# Output
# ------
#
# This script defines the following variables:
# - For each specified module XXX (system, window, graphics, network, audio, main):
#   - SFML_XXX_FOUND:  true if either the debug or release library of the xxx module is found
# - SFML_FOUND:        true if all the required modules are found
#
# And the following targets:
# - For each specified module XXX (system, window, graphics, network, audio, main):
#   - sfml-XXX
# The SFML targets are the same for both Debug and Release build configurations and will automatically provide
# correct settings based on your currently active build configuration. The SFML targets name also do not change
# when using dynamic or static SFML libraries.
#
# When linking against a SFML target, you do not need to specify indirect dependencies. For example, linking
# against sfml-graphics will also automatically link against sfml-window and sfml-system.
#
# example:
#   find_package(SFML 2 COMPONENTS graphics audio REQUIRED)
#   add_executable(myapp ...)
#   target_link_libraries(myapp sfml-graphics sfml-audio)
