# You do not need to add these to your projects

These are the original textures embedded into the Segues.
You can supply your own.
I use GIMP to export the png as .c source code with RGBA enabled (32 bit RGB)

View the [wiki](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/Swoosh/wiki/Embed-Texture) on how to change the embedded texture samples
