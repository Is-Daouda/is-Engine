/*
 * 1) Uncomment this line (definition of the Preporcessor which is below) to use the engine's main render loop.
 * 2) But if you want to use a basic SFML render loop comment out this line.
 *    It activates the "basicSFMLmain()" function which launches an SFML window.
 *    Very useful if you already have an existing project and want to integrate it into the engine.
 *    The "basicSFMLmain()" function is implemented in the "basicSFMLmain.cpp" file (found in the "cpp" directory).
 *    It is in this file that you can associate your code with that of the engine.
